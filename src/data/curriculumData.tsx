        <p>
          In Mozambique, students face a significant information gap regarding educational opportunities. The scarcity of updated information about
          scholarships and exchange programs on government websites keeps students from making informed decisions about courses, institutions, and
          scholarships, limiting their educational and professional potential.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Oportunidades&apos; goal is to be a comprehensive online platform that aggregates information on Mozambican universities nationwide. The platform
          will bridge the information gap, providing detailed insights into courses, admission requirements, and deadlines across all provinces.
