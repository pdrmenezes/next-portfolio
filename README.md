# Hi there!

- <strong>This is place to showcase personal projects and hobbies.</strong>

- <strong>It's always changing as I learn new technologies and experiment with them.</strong>

- <strong>It was first built with HTML and CSS (no JS).</strong>

- <strong>Now it's built with Next.js (w/ Typescript) + TailwindCSS + Motion (formerly Framer Motion) for the project animations.</strong>

- <strong>The entire website uses the Nohemi Font, created by [Rajesh Rajput](https://www.behance.net/rajputrajesh) who designs incredible typefaces.</strong>
